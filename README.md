# Complete MERN Authentication System

A robust and secure full-stack authentication system built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This project features high-level security with JWT, secure password resets, and automated email verification using OTPs.

## 🚀 Key Features:

User Registration & Login: Secure signup and login flow with hashed passwords.

Email Verification: Automated verification emails sent upon registration with a 6-digit OTP.

Password Reset: Secure "Forgot Password" workflow using email-based OTP verification.

JWT Authentication: Secure sessions using JSON Web Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.

Protected Routes: User-specific dashboard and actions restricted to authenticated users.

Dynamic UI: Clean and modern interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

Toast Notifications: Real-time feedback for all user actions (Success/Error).

Email Templates: Professionally styled HTML email templates for OTPs and welcome messages.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Frontend: 
React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Context API.

### Backend: 
Node.js, Express.js.

### Database: 
MongoDB (using Mongoose).

### Authentication: 
JWT (JsonWebToken), Bcrypt.js (Password hashing).

### Email Service: 
Nodemailer (for sending OTPs and verification emails).

### Other Tools:

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

``
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-auth-system.git
cd mern-auth-system
``

3. Backend Setup

``
cd backend
npm install
``

Create a .env file in the backend folder:

``
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
``

Run the server:

``
npm run server
``

3. Frontend Setup

``
cd frontend
npm install
``

Create a .env file in the frontend folder:

VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000

Run the app:
``
npm run dev
``

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

#### Passwords:
 Hashed using bcryptjs with salt rounds.

#### Tokens: 
jsonwebtoken is used to create secure access tokens.

#### Cookies: 
Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.

#### Validation: 
OTPs are time-sensitive and stored in the database with expiration timestamps.
